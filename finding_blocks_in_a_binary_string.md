110011
here we have two blocks.
how we find it?
code:
int total_blocks = 0;
for(int i=1; i<n; i++)
		{
			if(s[i]!=s[i-1])
			{
				total_blocks++;
			}
		}
total_blocks++;   //-->this is for last block.


What is a "block" in a binary string?
A block is a contiguous sequence of the same character (0 or 1).

For example, in "110011":

11 → Block 1

00 → Block 2

11 → Block 3
Total blocks = 3

Understanding the Code
cpp
Copy
Edit
int total_blocks = 0;
for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if(s[i] != s[i-1]) {
        total_blocks++;
    }
}
total_blocks++; // To count the last block
How it works:
s[i] != s[i-1] means a change from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0, which indicates the end of a block and start of a new one.

Every change adds 1 to total_blocks.

But this counts transitions, not blocks.

So we need to add 1 at the end to account for the first block which has no preceding transition.

✅ Example Walkthrough with "110011"
i = 1: 1 == 1 → no change

i = 2: 0 != 1 → block change → total_blocks = 1

i = 3: 0 == 0 → no change

i = 4: 1 != 0 → block change → total_blocks = 2

i = 5: 1 == 1 → no change

Now add 1: total_blocks = 3

✅ Final Output
So yes, this code correctly finds the number of blocks in a binary string.

If you'd like a cleaner version with comments:

cpp
Copy
Edit
int total_blocks = 0;
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (s[i] != s[i - 1]) {
        total_blocks++; // transition found → new block
    }
}
total_blocks++; // count the first block
Let me know if you want the same logic in Python or any other language.

if the binary is 1100 then how this will be calculated?

Let's analyze the binary string "1100" step by step using your logic and the code:

🔢 Binary String: "1100"
Index:    0 1 2 3
Characters: 1 1 0 0

So visually:

11 → Block 1

00 → Block 2

✅ Expected total blocks = 2

🔍 Code Analysis
cpp
Copy
Edit
int total_blocks = 0;
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (s[i] != s[i - 1]) {
        total_blocks++;
    }
}
total_blocks++; // count the first block
Let’s simulate it:

i = 1: s[1] = 1, s[0] = 1 → same → no change

i = 2: s[2] = 0, s[1] = 1 → different → total_blocks = 1

i = 3: s[3] = 0, s[2] = 0 → same → no change

Finally:
total_blocks = 1 + 1 = 2

✅ Final Answer:
Yes, for "1100", the code correctly calculates 2 blocks:

Block 1 → 11

Block 2 → 00
